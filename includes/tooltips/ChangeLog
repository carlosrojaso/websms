version 1.1c (January 28, 2007)

    -   further improvement on automatic tooltip repositioning in order to keep
        the tooltip in the visible part of the browser window if it would "flow"
        outside

version 1.1b (November 15, 2006)

    -   if a tooltip was larger than the visible area of the browser's screen
        the scrollbar would not disappear when the tooltip was hidden
    -   further improvement on automatic tooltip repositioning in order to keep
        the tooltip in the visible part of the browser window if it would "flow"
        outside

version 1.1 (November 15, 2006)

    -   in Firefox, the tooltips were showing up in the correct position only
        the first time - after that, the tooltips would show in the top left
        corner of the screen
    -   "sticky" tooltips can now be created - tooltips that follow the mouse
        cursor - you can do that by calling the "show" method on the
        onmousemove event rather than on the onmouseover event
    -   in Internet Explorer the vertical scrollbar would appear if a tooltip
        was shown
    -   improved automatic tooltip repositioning in order to keep the tooltip
        in the visible part of the browser window if it would "flow" outside
    -   some code clean up

version 1.0 (October 09, 2006)

    -   even though the examples were working fine, because of the ways paths
        were handled, you had to manually alter the paths in the template
        file in order for class to work in real life - that's outside of the
        examples folder :)
    -   transparency was not working in Safari
    -   the init() method can now be instructed to return the output instead of
        outputting it to the screen - useful when you're working with templating
        engines

version 1.0 BETA (September 25, 2006)

    -   initial release
